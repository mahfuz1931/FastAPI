This project demonstrates how to build a basic API using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL. 
It implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing user data in a MySQL database.
The project is structured to separate configuration, models, routes, and schemas into distinct 
folders, making the code clean and modular.
